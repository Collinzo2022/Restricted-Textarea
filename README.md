# Restricted-Textarea with Live Character Count

## Description
This project is a simple, responsive textarea component built with HTML,CSS, and JavaScript. The textarea allows users to type a message while displaying a live character count. The character turns red, and a red border appears around the textarea once the maximum character limit is reached.

## Features
- Live Character Count: Displays the current number of characters as the user types.
- Max Character Limit: Limits input to a maximum of 250 characters.
- Visual Feedback: Changes the character count text
and textarea border color to red when the limit is reached.

- CSS: Styling for the textarea, labels, and counter.
- JavaScript: Provides dynamic behavior for live characer counting and limit enforcement.
